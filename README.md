# Fourier-Analysis
Fourier Analysis of time series to identify and filter out unwanted frequencies # Fourier Analysis of Time Series In this notebook, we perform a complete Fourier analysis of a time series. The main objective is to decompose the signal into its constituent frequency components using the Fourier Transform, identify and filter out unwanted frequencies
